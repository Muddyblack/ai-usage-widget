"""Small state files the Plasma widget keeps outside its KConfig.

Plasma rewrites a panel's whole applet config file on every change and keeps
one config group per widget instance. Two things fit that badly, so they live
here instead:

* the last successful usage envelope, replayed (marked stale) while a freshly
  started widget waits for its first fetch. It carries account labels such as
  e-mail addresses, so it is a private cache file, not a line in
  ``plasma-org.kde.plasma.desktop-appletsrc``;
* the settings every widget instance shares (enabled providers, keys,
  appearance). Each instance merges its own changes in and adopts everyone
  else's, so a second panel or screen never needs to be configured again.
