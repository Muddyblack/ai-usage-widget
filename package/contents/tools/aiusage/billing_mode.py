"""Which local agents bill per token, and which are covered by a plan.

A session's cost is derived from its token counts times the catalog rate. On a
pay-as-you-go API key that product is money owed. On a Claude Pro/Max or a
ChatGPT/Codex plan it is only what the same work *would* have cost on the API —
the subscription already paid for it.

Mixing the two into one "local spend" total overstates what the user actually
pays, sometimes by orders of magnitude, so every session row carries the mode
it was priced under and the envelope totals them separately.

Only providers that expose a plan signal in credentials we already read are
classified; everything else is bring-your-own-key and therefore ``API``.
