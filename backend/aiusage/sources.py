"""Where a provider's numbers can come from, and which of those places work here.

Several providers can be read more than one way: Cursor through cursor-agent or
through the IDE, Antigravity through a CLI, the IDE's language server or ``agy``,
Copilot through a key, the editor login or the ``gh`` CLI. This module is the one
place that knows that, so a new way of reading a provider — a browser session,
say — is one more :class:`Source` in that provider's module and nothing else:

* the provider's module declares ``SOURCES`` (what exists, and a cheap stat-only
  probe for each);
* its fetch code asks :func:`candidates` which sources to try, in order;
* the normalizer chain attaches :func:`describe` to the envelope, which the
  settings UI draws without knowing any provider by name.

A user's choice lives in the shared settings file as ``sources: {provider: id}``
(``"auto"`` or absent means "try them in the default order, first that works").
An explicit choice is strict: only that source is tried, so what the tab says it
is using is what it is using.
