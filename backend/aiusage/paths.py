"""Where things live on this platform.

Almost everything a provider reads was written by another program, and that
program follows its platform's conventions: XDG directories on Linux,
%APPDATA% / %LOCALAPPDATA% on Windows, ~/Library on macOS. Every provider asks
here instead of spelling out ``~/.config`` itself.

The XDG variables win whenever they are set, on every platform. That keeps the
tests — which plant each file under a throwaway HOME and point XDG_* at it —
independent of the platform they run on.

macOS is the awkward one, because both conventions are genuinely in use there:
a tool written against XDG keeps reading ~/.config and ~/.local/share on a Mac
(Muse, glm-acp-agent), while one built on a cross-platform directories library
lands in ~/Library/Application Support (the Electron IDEs, kiro-cli). Neither
answer is right for all of them, so the *_dirs() functions hand back both, best
first, and a caller picks the one that exists — see first_file().

Dotfile homes such as ~/.claude, ~/.codex and ~/.gemini need nothing from this
module: those CLIs use ``%USERPROFILE%\\.<name>`` on Windows as well, which is
exactly what ``os.path.expanduser("~/.<name>")`` resolves to there.
